# Features in the Future

## Basic Functions

## Software Probject

## Network Performance

### TCP/IP

#### IPv6 Support

### HTTP

#### HTTP/2 Support

HTTP/2 is the next generation HTTP specification and concentrates on the performance of applications as well as security. The C-SDK must support it to extend to scenes where performance and/or security is very sensitive. This can be done through the abilities that CURL provides.

## Advanced Utilities

### Multiplex Communication

Usually, people maximize network bandwidth utility by using multiplex communication. A well-defined and fine tuned multiplex communication framework makes building applications much easier and faster.

## Advanced Tools

## Programming Language Bindings

The C-SDK is a good base as a low level implementation for making bindings to other programming languages. By this way, any language that is C extensible adopts the abilities to communicate with Qiniu Cloud Storage. The motivation to do this is purity and performance: the C-SDK does uploading and management in an uniform, controllable and meticulous way.

If we have enough time to do this, the following languages' binding will be implemented:

- Lua
- Ruby
- Python
- Javascript / Node.js
