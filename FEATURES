# Features in the Future

## TCP/IP Features

## HTTP Features

### HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is the next generation HTTP specification and concentrates on the performance of applications as well as security. The C-SDK must support it to extend to scenes where performance and/or security is very sensitive. This can be done by using the abilities that CURL provides.

## Programming Language Bindings

The C-SDK can be used as a low level implementation to make bindings for other programming languages. By this way, any language that is C extensible can adopt the abilities to communicate with Qiniu Cloud Storage. The motivation to do this is purity and performance: the C-SDK does uploading and management in an uniform, controllable and meticulous way.

If we have enough time to do this, the following languages' binding will be implemented:

- Lua
- Ruby
- Python
- Javascript / Node.js
